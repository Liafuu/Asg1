# Amehurashi Website project
This is project about a website for a band called 'Amehurashi',
containing a Main Page, Details Page, Short Stories page and Merch page.

## Design Process
I am mainly focusing this website for both the audience of Amehurashi and those who are curious about the band.
I want to help grow the band's audience count as it is very underrated, with only 1 million views on their most popular video.
With a good website, it is a good way to help grow their audience for those curious enough to check the band out.
- As a student who likes listening to music and finding out the stories behind them, I would like to access those stories easily with only a few clicks of a button.
- As a fan of the band, I would like to be redirected to their merchandise store with ease.
